I don't own the contents of this directory. I've included the header collage and explicitly added this notice to emphasis these aren't my marks, I'm not affiliated with the companies, and all that.

## Legal Stuff

I'm still pretty new to the whole CYA legal thing. I really like everything I've covered here, and I've done my best to respect individual legal policies. If I screwed something up, please send me an email ASAP so I can fix it.

* The Electronic Frontier Foundation and `certbot` are covered by [EFF's generous copyright](https://www.eff.org/copyright). As far as I know, it's all under [CC BY 3.0 US](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/). I made a few minor tweaks to build the banner image but tried to respect the trademark. I don't know who the `certbot` logo artist is but I really wish I did because it's a fantastic piece of art.
* Let's Encrypt [is trademarked](https://letsencrypt.org/trademarks/). Its logo uses [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). I made a few minor tweaks to build the banner image but tried to respect the trademark.
* I didn't find anything definitive (other than EULAs) covering Nginx, which doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Assets were taken [from its press page](https://www.nginx.com/press/). The logo was rotated to not be entirely hidden behind the lead paragraph.
* Apache content was sourced from [its press page](https://www.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/). It provides [a full trademark policy](http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/). The logo was rotated to not be entirely hidden behind the lead paragraph.

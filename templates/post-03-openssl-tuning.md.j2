This post sets up all the backend security logic (minus headers) to harden Nginx or Apache. I've tried to provide an explanation of each component and good values to use (or the means to create your own). If you don't have OpenSSL, most of this is meaningless.

## Primary Security Reference

I'll be using [the Qualys suggested configuration](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices) to set this up. Most of this stuff is explained elsewhere on the internet. I wanted to grok the whole process, so I wrote it up.

If you're reading this more than, say, a month or two from its publication date, I'd strongly urge you to follow the documentation links to find the most current algorithms, best practices, and so on. Even if my minutae is current, you should always check sources when security is involved.

## Primary Config File

This creates a single file to hold the common config.

[As I said before](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/lets-encrypt-from-start-to-finish-first-steps/#reuselocation), I like `/etc/<server>/common/`, YMMV.

### Nginx

{{
    shell_session("""\
$ sudo touch /etc/nginx/common/ssl.conf
"""
    )
}}

### Apache

So this probably won't work without some TLC. Apache differentiates global vs scoped config, and some of the things I mention only work in one or the other. [The official docs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslprotocol) state scope per directive and I've tried to match that. However, I'm going to pretend like it will work without issue and hope no one says anything.

{{
    shell_session("""\
$ sudo touch /etc/httpd/common/ssl.conf
"""
    )
}}

You'll also need to ensure you've got the right modules installed and running. Depending [on your server's distro](https://askubuntu.com/a/600902) and the version of Apache you're running, installing and enabling modules is done differently.

{{
    shell_session("""\
$ which a2enmod && echo \"apache2\" || echo \"httpd\"
RHEL is usually httpd
Debian is usually apache2
"""
    )
}}

* If you're running `httpd`, enable them by editing `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-base.conf` (or another file there; you might have to `grep` them out).
* If you're running `apache2`, enable them via `a2enmod`.

You'll need these modules:

* `mod_rewrite`
* `mod_ssl`
* `mod_socache_shmcb` for any caching (sessions, stapling)

{{
    shell_session("""\
$ eval \"$(which apachectl && echo apachectl || echo httpd) -M\" | grep -E \"rewrite|shmcb|ssl\"
 rewrite_module (shared)
 socache_shmcb_module (shared)
 ssl_module (shared)
"""
    )
}}

You might actually have to install additional external packages depending on how you get Apache, e.g. `mod_ssl` on RHEL systems.

## Specify Allowed TLS Versions

Qualys says [`v1.2` is the only secure version](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices#22-use-secure-protocols). `v1.3` is [only a draft](https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/), so including it might be odd. If you're truly desperate, `v1.1` isn't too bad. Don't forget that Qualys writes the benchmark, so if you ignore that advice, your rating will take a hit.

### Nginx

{{
    highlight_block("""\
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
""",
        explicit_lexer_name = 'NginxConfLexer',
        no_header = True
    )
}}

### Apache

{{
    highlight_block("""\
SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.2
""",
        explicit_lexer_name = 'ApacheConfLexer',
        no_header = True
    )
}}

## Generate a List of Good Ciphers

You might check [the current list](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices#23-use-secure-cipher-suites) to make sure this is up-to-date. You can also shorten this list; I was curious how it was built.

We can use `grep` to search with a pattern from a `-f`ile, composed of newline-separated `-F`ixed strings, where each pattern matches the entire line (`-x`). All we need is the available ciphers. `openssl ciphers` returns a colon-separated list, so we can pass it through `tr`anslate before searching it.

If you didn't get any results, you should probably spend the few days necessary to move everything to a platform at least from the last decade. Or maybe `openssl` didn't get set up correctly.

Unfortunately, this doesn't retain the order Qualys uses, and I've yet to figure out a good way to maintain the original order. A standard `bash` approach would be to `comm`pare the two lists, but `comm` expects the lists to be sorted.

{{
    shell_session("""\

    )
}}

Brace expansion doesn't reduce the size by much, so I gave up after a few hours on that tangent. However, the important thing is that you now know what ciphers are available for you to use that also have the Qualys stamp of approval.

## Specify ECDHE Curve

Qualys suggests using a [specific elliptic curve for ECDHE](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices#26-use-strong-key-exchange). [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography), like other algorithms, has both secure and insecure methods. Also like other algorithms, there are [a few common, widely used components](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5480#section-2.1.1.1). Qualys recommends [`secp256r1` or `P-256`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5480#page-6). Coincidentally, that curve has [most likely been backdoored by government agencies for years](https://it.slashdot.org/story/13/09/11/1224252/are-the-nist-standard-elliptic-curves-back-doored) and has even been [put down by government agencies more recently](http://blog.bettercrypto.com/?p=1917).

I mention that because there's basically no way to protect yourself from actors with superior tech. No matter what you do, there's always someone with more money and decades of classified algebra and combinatorics to keep you grounded. However, unless some of that knowledge has been put to code and leaked recently, most of the cryptography mentioned here will probably prevent wardriving script kiddies from messing with you or your users for a few years.

If you'd like to use something a bit more secure, [check out SafeCurves](https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/). Like before, we'll need to check what's available to us with the installed version of OpenSSL.

{{
    shell_session("""\

"""
    )
}}

Comparing my list to SafeCurves yields zero safe curves. That's because OpenSSL has rolled [most of those into `v1.1`](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.0-notes.html), which isn't in stable channels yet (and probably won't ever make it to LTS channels).

{{
    shell_session("""\
$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.2g  1 Mar 2016
"""
    )
}}

That means we have two options:

1. Update OpenSSL manually and hope nothing system-critical actually needed the older version.
2. Pick the best from what we've got for now.

The first involves a ton of extra work (it's all fairly straightforward, just super involved), so I'm going to cover that in a later post, once I'm finished with the current slate. That leaves us with making due with what we've got. Mozilla recommends [`prime256v1`, `secp384r1`, and `secp521r1` for modern compatibility](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Modern_compatibility) (actually for any compatibility).

{{

## Generate Diffie-Hellman Group

Vanilla OpenSSL is susceptible to [Logjam](https://weakdh.org/) (among other things), so you'll want to create a new Diffie-Hellman group. Qualys [mentions this as well](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices#26-use-strong-key-exchange); basically, don't use defaults.

## Use Server Cipher Preference

Having done all of this work to actually set up cipher precedence and curves and lots of other things, it's important to actually specify we'd prefer it if clients would use our configuration instead of theirs. Assuming all methods are the same (which is actually a horrible assumption), we have more control with our configuration.

### Nginx

{{
    highlight_block("""\
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
""",
        explicit_lexer_name = 'NginxConfLexer',
        no_header = True
    )

## OCSP Stapling

[OCSP Stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) makes things a little bit simpler for Let's Encrypt. To verify a cert's veracity, clients historically had to send a request to the CA, negotiate that, and then, knowing the cert was valid, hit the intended address. OCSP stapling allows your server to periodically timestamp its validity through the magic of digital signatures.

### Nginx

This config requires [also setting `ssl_trusted_certificate`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_stapling_verify). This will be handled later, once we actually request a cert.

{{
    highlight_block("""\
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
""",
        explicit_lexer_name = 'NginxConfLexer',
        no_header = True
    )
}}

It's fairly common to see a `resolver` defined as well, and equally common to see it defined as Google.

{{
    highlight_block("""\
resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4;
""",
        explicit_lexer_name = 'NginxConfLexer',
        no_header = True
    )
}}

I'm not a huge fan of this because it routes everything to Google. If left out, the resolver defaults to your DNS. Theoretically, my DNS already knows a user is checking me out. Google doesn't need to be involved for the same reasons [OCSP stapling was created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol#Privacy_concerns).

### Apache

Apache doesn't [make it easy](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/ssl/ssl_howto.html#ocspstapling). Here's [a Stack Exchange thread](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/394074) that seems to cover the important stuff. This is the first of many times [the new Apache cache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_socache_shmcb.html) will pop up, and, every single time, it requires manual setup.

{{
    highlight_block("""\

        explicit_lexer_name = 'ApacheConfLexer',

    )
}}

## SSL Session

As a fullstack dev who spends most of his time performing brute force data analysis and putting out fires, I honestly don't have a good baseline for what is or is not a safe config. Mozilla might have [abandoned open communication](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/EME) to court [the favor of big corporations](https://boingboing.net/2017/09/21/democracy-dies-in-dullness.html), but they still occasionally support the little dev (just not [the end user](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/update-looking-glass-add/)). [The Mozilla TLS Config Generator](https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/) is a fantastic tool to generate actually strong defaults. After reading several hundred posts about Nginx and Apache hardening for a couple of weekends, I've come to recognize the Mozilla standards pretty well. That was my long-winded way of saying this is section is total copypasta.

Due to [a security issue](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#TLS_tickets_.28RFC_5077.29), Mozilla doesn't recommend using [session tickets](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077). More recently, [at least one named vulnerability](https://filippo.io/Ticketbleed/) has popped up regarding session tickets, so use them at your own risk.

### Nginx

{{
    highlight_block("""\

        explicit_lexer_name = 'NginxConfLexer',
        no_header = True
    )
}}

### Apache

Apache again [makes this difficult](https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/SSLSessionCache). It does look like disabling tickets is easy, so they've got that going for them, which is nice.

{{
    highlight_block("""\

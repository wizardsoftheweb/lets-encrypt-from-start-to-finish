## Before You Go

Let's Encrypt is a fantastic service. If you like what they do, i.e. appreciate how accessible they've made secure web traffic, [please donate](https://letsencrypt.org/donate/). [EFF's `certbot`](https://certbot.eff.org/) is what powers my site (and basically anything I work on these days); consider [buying them a beer](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/support-lets-encrypt) (it's really just a donate link but you catch my drift).

## Legal Stuff

I'm still pretty new to the whole CYA legal thing. I really like everything I've covered here, and I've done my best to respect individual legal policies. If I screwed something up, please send me an email ASAP so I can fix it.

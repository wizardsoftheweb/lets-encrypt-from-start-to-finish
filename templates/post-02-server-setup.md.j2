This post is all about getting your machine ready to run itself. I've tried to actually explain everything that went into the configuration, which was very useful to me and hopefully offers something to you. I provide a general Linux approach, a tested Nginx configuration, and some Apache stuff I researched because I'll probably have to support that at work.

## Prototypical Resources

I've been shuffling around copypasta Let's Encrypt config since, I think, the middle of last year (the company's only 19 months old, so it couldn't have been much longer than that). I don't have VCS versions of any of that, so unfortunately I can't point to a single article or book that shaped this. This list deserves highlighting if for no other reason than I had the link saved and totally forgot where I was going to use it.

* [This Gist](https://gist.github.com/cecilemuller/a26737699a7e70a7093d4dc115915de8) is a great resource to snag a stable config you can put almost anywhere.
* [This Gist](https://gist.github.com/AndreiD/3d4b36c58fa59c8ec1ef98276eacb636) is another great resouce. I believe I've had portions of it in production at some point.
* [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) is the SSL gold standard. If you don't have a good Qualys rating, you don't have a good config.
* Mozilla provides [a great generator](https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/) that's probably responsible for a fair chunk of the articles out there now.
